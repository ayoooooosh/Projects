                        It is said that books are a man’s best friend. A person who inculcates 
                        the habit of reading never feels bored or lonely. He has his books to 
                        give him company wherever he goes. He wouldn’t feel bored while he is 
                        travelling alone, he won’t feel left out if he is home on a Friday evening 
                        and he won’t feel lonely in a gathering where he doesn’t know many people as 
                        he can always carry his best friend along wherever he goes.
